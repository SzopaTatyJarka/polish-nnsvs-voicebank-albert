# polish-nnsvs-voicebank-albert
This is an NNSVS library for the Polish language created using a dataset recorded from a classically trained baritone. It's intended to use with a compatible software like [ENUNU](https://github.com/oatsu-gh/ENUNU) or [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau). References on how to use the voicebank can be found in the `readme.txt` and `SzopaTatyJarka PL NN Phoneme set.txt`. The library also comes with 5 example score files to test the voicebank on.

It's recommended to use the voicebank with OpenUTAU as it allows for flexible vocal editing, live playback and more. If using UTAU, ENUNU ver.0.4.0 is recommended.

This library also supports Japanese hiragana input and allows for Japanese singing with an accent.
