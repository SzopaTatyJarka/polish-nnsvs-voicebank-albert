# polish-nnsvs-voicebank-albert
This is an NNSVS library for Polish language created using a dataset recorded from a clasically trained baritone. It's intended to use with compatible software like [ENUNU](https://github.com/oatsu-gh/ENUNU) or [OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau). Refferences how to use the voicebank can be found in the `readme.txt` and `SzopaTatyJarka PL NN Phoneme set.txt`. The library also comes with 5 example score files to test the voicebank on.

*Usage example in UTAU*

It's reccomended to use the voicebank with OpenUTAU as it allows for flexible vocal editing, live playback and more. *It doesn't support following the pitch generated by the model yet, although this will change with time*

This library also supports Japanese hiragana input and allowing for Japanese singing with an accent.
